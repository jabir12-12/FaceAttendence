# AI-Based Attendance System

Hello everyone!  
I’ve created a simple and smart Attendance System using facial recognition. This web-based system allows students to mark attendance automatically via a camera interface. It's designed to be efficient, user-friendly, and easy to use in classrooms or small institutions.

## Features

- Facial Recognition Attendance  
- Live Camera Feed  
- Student Registration System  
- Database Integration  
- Attendance Logs  
- Clear Records Feature  

## How It Works

### Go to the Website  
(Link will be provided here)

### Start Attendance  
- Click the **Start Camera** button.  
- The system will scan your face.

### Recognition & Attendance  
- If you're already registered, your attendance will be marked automatically.  
- If not, you’ll be shown as Unknown.

### Register New Student  
- Click on **Register**.  
- Enter your **Roll Number** and **Name**.  
- Your face data and info will be stored securely.

### View Attendance  
- Click **View Attendance** to see the log.  
- You can also Clear Records if needed.

### Stop Camera  
- Once done, click **Stop Camera** to end the session.

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Flask  
- Firebase  
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend)

## Notes

- Make sure your webcam is accessible.  
- The face recognition works best in well-lit environments.  
- Database can be extended to support more features like:
  - Class-wise tracking  
  - Export to CSV  
  - Real-time analytics
